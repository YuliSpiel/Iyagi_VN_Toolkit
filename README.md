---

## Overview

**Iyagi_VN_Toolkit** is a Unity toolkit designed for fast and flexible **visual novel prototyping** using Google Spreadsheets.
It allows you to write dialogue, choices, background changes, and simple events directly in Google Sheets — then automatically parses and displays them in Unity.

This system is easily extendable, making it ideal for both beginners and advanced users who want to manage dialogue and scenario data outside of Unity.
