Important Notes
--------------------

- The 3000px size images are very high resolution, resulting in large file sizes (over 800MB total).
  It is recommended to selectively download only the necessary characters.
- The demo scene uses the 1000px size illustrations.
  You must download the 1000px data to use the demo scene.
- The demo scene prioritizes performance, so the image quality is lower compared to the 3000px version.
- All illustrations were generated using AI tools and manually refined.
  Additional facial expression parts were manually created to improve quality.
